# Question-Answer
## Objective
   To make sure our application is accessed by humans and not a by any computers or bot.
## Description
   We want to make sure that the users who are using our application knows how to add numbers. To achieve this, we want to provide the user/client with a question and then allow
   the user/client to submit an answer. If the user/client and the service were both real person, then they would have interacted in the following manner:
   
   **Client:** Hey Service, can you provide me a question with numbers to add?<br/>
   **Service:** Here you go, solve the question: “Please sum the numbers 9,5,3”.<br/>
   **Client:** Great. The original question was “Please sum the numbers 9,5,3” and the answer is 15.<br/>
   **Service:** That’s wrong. Please try again.<br/>
   **Client:** Sorry, the original question was “Please sum the numbers 9,5,3” and the answer is 17.<br/>
   **Service:** That’s great<br/>
